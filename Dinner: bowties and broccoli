<ul>Bring a pot of water to a boil, then add the pasta. Boil until the pasta is al dente (7-10 minutes).

Transfer the pasta and broccoli back to the pot (with the heat off) or to a bowl and add the butter. Toss until the butter has melted and coated everything. Add the Parmesan, salt, freshly cracked pepper, and red pepper flakes, then toss to coat again. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve immediately.</br>
