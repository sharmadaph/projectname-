<h1>Tofu Scamble</h1>
<h4>Tofu scramble is a delicious vegan breakfast that's loaded with plant-based protein and vegetables. Choosing the right type of tofu is key to achieving a tender scrambled eggs consistency.To make the tofu visually appear similar to eggs, a small amount of turmeric coats the pieces for a sunshine yellow color.

<li>Mash the tofu with a fork but leave some nice big chunks. </li>
<li>Add the nutritional yeast, turmeric, paprika, dijon mustard, garlic powder, black salt and onion powder to a bowl. Then add the soy milk and whisk it in so you have a nice sauce..</li>
<li>Add the vegan butter to a frying pan and heat until hot. Add the tofu and fry it until lightly browned, being careful not to break it up too much when moving it around the pan.</li>
<li>Add the sauce and fold it in. Fry it until youâ€™ve achieved desired consistency, the tofu will absorb the sauce so you can have it as wet or as dry as you like.</li>
<li>Top with some black pepper and chopped chives and serve with some fried tomatoes and sliced avocado</li>
